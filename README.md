# ACRN - RISCV64

## Overview
The aim of the project is to enable [ACRN][ACRN] for the [RISCV64][RISCV64] architecture. This project is currently under development and is not yet ready for production. Once this support is implemented and has sufficient quality, it is intended for this port to become a part of the upstream ACRN project and to continue further development there.

The RV-ACRN hypervisor has two working modes:
1) m-ACRN running in M-mode with mem virtualization based on PMP and vcpu context switch in pure software way. m-ACRN is targeted to run on legacy RISCV64 machine without H-ext.
2) h-ACRN running in HS-mode with full H-ext support. h-ACRN is targeted to run on RISCV64 machine with H-ext.

The project is presented at RISC-V summit China 2023.

## Current State

The current development is based on QEMU RV64 virtual platform. The ACRN hypervisor has bootup successfully to ACRN console with the support of SMP, MMU, CLINT & PLIC. The basic virtualization support includes VM lifecycle management, vCPU context switch, memory virtualization via stage-2 page-table translation, IO virtualization via MMIO emulation, as well as IRQ virtualization with CLINT & PLIC emulation.  

Besides, m-ACRN has been verified on both RV64-QEMU virtual platform and TH1520 based hardware platform. Such configurations can run well as Duo-Linux-VMs, Linux SOS + Android UOS, and etc.

h-ACRN is just tested on RV64-QEMU with a built-in KTEST kernel for unit test purpose. Linux VM support is in the TODO list.
